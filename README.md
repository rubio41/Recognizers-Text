Microsoft.Recognizers.Text provides robust recognition and resolution of numbers, units, and date/time expressed in multiple languages. Full support for Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese. More on the way.

Nuget packages - for the base classes and the different supported entities - are available in nuget.org at: https://www.nuget.org/profiles/Recognizers.Text

Microsoft.Recognizers.Text currently has implementations in C# and Javascript! NPM packages will be available soon.

Contributions are greatly welcome! Both for fixes in the current supported languages and expansions to new ones.
Especially for Japanese, Korean, German, and Dutch.
